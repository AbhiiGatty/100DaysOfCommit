# # 100DaysOfCommit

Lost focus, Distracted and plain lazy. Programming still seems fun for the most part, It was keeping track of my progress and being able to show or display the work i've done that becomes a pain and i keep forgetting to create a repo or loose what stage of some project i was in and lost track of ideas along the way.  

# The Decision
The idea is inspired from [100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) which would've been great but they use twitter to keep track of their progress which was a big no no for me. So i made up 100DaysOfCommit * mind blown *, where i trust the dev community of GitHub a bit more to be like a sarcastic brother encouraging me and showing me new things out there while making fun of my coding standards.

# Things to be worked on

# Rules
No rules cause rules are meant to be broken but systematic guidelines and structures keep the world sane.
* Each day will be a branch
* Each activity will have its own folder

# Final Words
As the Cromulons say 'SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT! I WANT TO SEE WHAT YOU GOT!', So feel free to **put up issues with links to resources you want me to have a look at or any other sort of material**. Not like i am expecting any attention to this but just in case someone does think of helping me along by suggesting then there you go and i will keep updating the table of the cool things that i discover. 
Treat this as a sort of experiment of what someone could do along the same lines to get better at what they love to do. FYI, i am a computer science engineering student who prominetly works on a linux system(debian), codes in python and understands simple concepts of networking and algorithms and also know how to pronounce GIF.
